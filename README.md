UDT.go A Golang wrapper for the UDT project
=================================================

UDT can be found on SourceForge http://udt.sourceforge.net/

### Getting Started

Run the build.sh script to compile the UDT C library.  You'll need g++ on your
system to compile it.  I've only tested the build on x86_64 OSX at this point
so you may need to tweak the build script for your system.  If you do, tweak
the build script please submit a pull request.
