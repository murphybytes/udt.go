UDT.go A Golang wrapper for the UDT project
=================================================

UDT can be found on SourceForge http://udt.sourceforge.net/

### Getting Started

You'll need to compile the UDT C source code.  To do this run the build script
that is located in the root directory of the project.  You'll need g++ on your
system to successfully compile the UDT C library.  I've only tested the build on
x86_64 OSX so you may need to tweak the build script for your system.  If you
do get the build working on other systems please submit a pull request.
